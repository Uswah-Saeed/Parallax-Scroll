# Parallax-Scroll

Parallax-scroll Web page using HTML, CSS and JS

Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background
moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as 
visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more 
immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on optical illusion.
